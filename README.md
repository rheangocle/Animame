# Animame

## Summary
Animame is a website where users can search up food from their favorite anime shows. Upon opening the site, users can search for any anime based on the title. Then, the user is presented with a page that displays an image of the anime and information including summary, titles, and ratings for the show. In addition, the user will be presented with various recipes inspired by the show to choose from. Clicking on the recipe card will load instructions and ingredients to prepare the meal. The user can also browse through other anime titles if desired.
